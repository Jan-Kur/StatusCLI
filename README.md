## Installation

Download the appropriate version for your operating system and architecture from the [releases page](https://github.com/Jan-Kur/StatusCLI/releases/latest).

You can either run the executable directly or add it to your PATH to run the CLI from any directory.

### Note

Some terminals and fonts don't support emojis, or only some of them. If you input an emoji and see ï¿½ in the terminal instead, the CLI should update the status emoji to a default ðŸ’¬.
